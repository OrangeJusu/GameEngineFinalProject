This is a small game made with a very basic game engine using SDL.
I made the base game engine and designed a game with it, both are
included in the files.


Notes:

Use arrow keys to move around
Use F to shoot
Use shift to run

To play the game use the executable file in the zip called VarioTheGermanElectrian
Remember to extract the files or else the program will not reconize SDL
