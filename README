This is a small game made with a very basic game engine using SDL.
I made the base game engine and designed a game with it, both are
included in the files. The game was originally going to be a mario clone,
but in the semester I ran out of time and I made Grand Theft Blocko instead.


Notes:

Use arrow keys to move around
Use F to shoot
Use shift to run

To play the game use the executable file in the zip called VarioTheGermanElectrian
Remember to extract the files or else the program will not reconize SDL
